        <h1>Terms and Conditions:</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Order/Cancellation Policy:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We require proof of payment of 50% deposit of the total invoice price, to confirm your order. It is
          important to note that no order is considered confirmed, nor will collection dates be honoured, until
          proof of payment has been received. No refunds are given.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Transportation and Storage of cakes:</h3>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Delivery is a fee in addition to the cake, and is pending availability. (Please enquire)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once the cake is delivered/collected, the cake is no longer my responsibility</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>If collecting, kindly make note of the below tips for transporting your cake:</h3>
          <br>
  
          <ul>
            <li>In the car, it is best to place the cake on the car floor, a person’s lap can be unstable and depending on the driver’s ability,  who knows what can happen when the cake is on the car seat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you can, put the car aircon on, our products are heat sensitive.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Carry the box with two hands and ensure your hands are placed underneath the box to
              support the cake board.</li>
              <br>
            <li>Do not leave the cake out in the sun, the icing may melt and ruin it’s fabulous appearance!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Our products are to be kept in the fridge until an hour before serving.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Last-minute/rushed orders</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Kindly note that while Last-Minute orders can be accommodated, we are at the mercy of our
              suppliers and loadshedding. WIth cakes that require toppers which are custom made, our
              suppliers need notice in advance. Loadshedding can limit baking times so we also have to
              factor that in, to maintain our high standards.</li>
              <br>
            <li>If the cake has fresh flowers for decoration, the flowers provided are subject to my Florist’s
              variety and may not be exactly as per the reference image, however I do everything in my
              power to ensure accuracy and likeness is maintained.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Allergies:</h3>
          <p>Our products contain gluten, dairy, eggs and may contain nuts (depending on the recipe). If you have
            any special dietary requirements, it is your responsibility as the client to advise on this during the
            quoting phase. Also keep this in mind when ordering as a gift for someone. On request I am able to
            provide gluten-free, reduced sugar, dairy free alternatives.</p>
